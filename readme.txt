WWU Physics Demonstration Scheduler

Drupal 7 Module developed with a group of students as a final project for WWU CS degree over the course of three quarters. The project involved requirements gathering, design, and implementation of the final product.

The client was a staff member with the university’s physics department who needed an online system where faculty could reserve equipment for classroom demonstrations. The final product was implemented in Drupal because the physics department website is built in Drupal. The maintenance of this project has since been turned over to the university’s web technologies department.
